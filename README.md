This repository is for practising the GitHub Flow.
My name is Kuhu Gupta. I am a 3rd Year B.Tech student at Mahindra University. I am currently majoring in Artificial Intelligence. My hobbies are art, mainly sketching or painting, and writing stories. I like listening to pop music and maintaining a journal. I want to become a Data Scientist someday.
